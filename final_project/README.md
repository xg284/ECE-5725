Photo displayer

Our project is a photo displayer with two components: a web application which allows users to upload pictures to the Raspberry Pi; a slideshow application reads photos from the server, displays them on the touch screen, and controlled by six functional touch-screen buttons, including lock the current photo (stop the transition), switch to the previous and next photos, speed up or down the transition time, and quit the program.
Just imagine that you can upload a new selfie to the server through the web application, and all your family members can see it on the Raspberry Pi at home. Donâ€™t hesitate, share your photos with your family!
