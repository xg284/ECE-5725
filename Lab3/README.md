Lab3 
• Add output capability to the R-Pi through exploration of a number of attached components.

• Build a robot platform for the RPi

• Explore robot applications for the RPi and integrate these with piTFT feedback

• One overall goal will be the development of modular code blocks that can be reused in successive steps of the lab. 
  
  o Consider software design before beginning code in order to map operations into python functions that may be used in future parts of the lab.
  
  o Plan to show design of software modules, used to achieve some degree of modularity, in your lab report
