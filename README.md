# ECE-5725 Design with Embedded Operating Systems
Cornell University

Design of microcontroller based systems using embedded Linux. Student teams design and debug example solutions on a target microcontroller (for example, Raspberry Pi) during lab sessions. Emphasis will be on application and Linux programming skills, processor and microcontroller architecture with some discussion of hardware interfaces. Students create a final, end-ofsemester project using the microcontroller platform and development techniques discussed during the semester.
